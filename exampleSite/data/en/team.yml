    content: I have worked in IT around 10 years and have been a System Administrator
      for around 3 of those years. I began learning Powershell as a means to automate
      dull tasks, mainly around Active Directory, and I caught the bug. I now spend
      most of my day either in VSCode or a Powershell console in some way shape or
      form.
